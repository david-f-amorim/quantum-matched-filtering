## README

This repository contains relevant code for quantum matched filtering, to be considered in conjunction with the meeting slides and final project report. 

The code used to produce numerical simulations of quantum matched filtering is given in the file `numerics.py`. 


#### Legacy Code

The files `report_plot_fig_1.py` and `report_plot_figs_3_4.py` were used to generate Figure 1 and Figures 3 & 4, respectively, in the project report. The file `simulations_meeting_15.py` contains the code used to generate the simulations shown from slide 19 onwards at meeting 15. These files likely have no relevance in future work on quantum matched filtering and have only been included in the repository for completeness. The code is thus mostly uncommented.
